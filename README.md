# 👋 Hi, I'm Dani 

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a developer who dabbles in just about everything, but my home base is the wild world of front-end. 

## 🧑‍💻 About Me

- **Main focus:** Front-end development, but I’m not afraid to venture into the unknown (how else do you find the cool things?).
- **Top skills:**  
  - ⚛️ React enthusiast (I can't promise I only use useEffect when absolutely necessary)
  - 🎨 SASS wizard (BEM methodology, I personally hate kebab-case, in fact if you don't use camelCase, i hate you)
  - 🌐 Web explorer (if it runs in a browser, I’m interested)
  - 🤖 Bot Maker, I love making bots that interact with people and automate tasks, i don't know why.
- **Always learning:** I love diving into new tech and weird projects. If it’s new to me, I’m probably already knee-deep in for hours without noticing, even when I don't have anything specifically to do.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

- [rol](https://github.com/ddm19/rol): A custom webpage for my D&D games. Roll for initiative! [WIP]
- [bunkatcg](https://github.com/ddm19/bunkatcg): An e-commerce project—because someone has to pay for my 3D printing filament.

## 🎲 Hobbies

- 🖨️ 3D printing (if you hear a whirring sound, it's probably my printer getting stuck)
- 🎮 Game development (one day I’ll finish a game before starting a new one... maybe)
- 🧙‍♂️ Dungeons & Dragons (see above: [rol])
- 🌍 Everything (Creative) that involves making anything that someone will use.
